# iOS device (arm64) cross-build for picoruby → libmruby.a for the iphoneos
# SDK (physical device). prism compiler + VM are baked in, so Ruby is compiled &
# run at runtime in-app. Mirrors the cross-build shape of picoruby's
# r2p2-picoruby-pico2.rb (target cc + host_command) and R2P2-macOS darwin defines.
#
# PICORB_PLATFORM_POSIX is intentionally omitted: iOS has __APPLE__
# defined but not gethostuuid() or other macOS-only POSIX APIs used by the
# picoruby-machine posix port. Without POSIX, the gemboxes that depend on it
# (core, stdlib) are also dropped so only the bare VM + compiler are built in.
