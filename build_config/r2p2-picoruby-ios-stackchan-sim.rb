# install a false fallback (guarded — a tree that defines darwin? keeps its
# own). false is the right answer for an iOS static-.a cross-build: the gem's
# `if build.darwin?` branch (swift build of a macOS dylib + -lPicoBLEDarwin
# linker flags + its own ports glob) is macOS-host glue. This config does the
# Darwin port selection itself (conf.ports :darwin) and adds the Swift-header
# include path — keeping the iOS glue in this repo, not the picoruby tree.
# The Swift backend links into the APP target, not into libmruby.a; pble_*
# stay undefined in the .a, which is expected.
