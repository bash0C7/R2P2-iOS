# Host build used only to link the bridge smoke test (Task 2). Its gem set is
# kept in EXACT parity with build_config/r2p2-picoruby-ios-sim.rb so the smoke
# test, which links against THIS build, actually predicts what the reduced
# ios-sim libmruby.a can run. Toolchain is host-appropriate (plain MRuby::Build,
# no -arch/-isysroot). PICORB_PLATFORM_POSIX is dropped to mirror ios-sim for
# maximum parity (it builds clean on the host without it).
