# R2P2-iOS

A self-contained harness for building and running PicoRuby on iOS — on the
Simulator and on a signed physical device. It cross-builds picoruby into a
static library, links it into SwiftUI apps through a thin C bridge, and ships
examples that put the application's behavior in Ruby.

## What this is

`R2P2-iOS` connects picoruby to the iOS build system (Xcode / xcodebuild /
Simulator / signing). It is the analogue of **R2P2-ESP32** on the iOS axis: a
permanent, self-contained harness, because iOS is its own substantial external
build system the way ESP-IDF is. It does **not** depend on R2P2-macOS.

picoruby is a common PicoRuby core whose mrbgems carry per-architecture
implementations under `mrbgems/<gem>/ports/<arch>/` (rp2040 / posix / esp32 /
darwin …) behind identical interfaces. R2P2-iOS's job is to hold the iOS
**build configs** that select the iOS-appropriate ports, plus the C bridge and
the example apps. iOS-specific glue lives here; the picoruby tree stays pristine.

picoruby bakes the prism compiler into the VM, so the cross-built `libmruby.a`
compiles and runs Ruby source at runtime, on the device.

## Setup

```
# full Xcode.app (App Store) — the iOS SDK / Simulator / xcodebuild live here;
# Command Line Tools alone are NOT enough. Point the toolchain at it (needs sudo):
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license accept

brew install xcodegen         # generates each example's Xcode project
# Ruby — any ambient install (rbenv / asdf / system) >= 2.7
```

```
rake check                    # verifies full Xcode / iOS SDK / xcodegen
```

The picoruby tree and deployment target are selectable by env:

```
PICORUBY_REPO   default: https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby.git
PICORUBY_REF    default: master
IOS_MIN         default: 17.0   (iOS deployment minimum)
EXAMPLE         default: repl   (which examples/<name> the base ios:* tasks build)
```

## Examples

Each example has its own README explaining where and how PicoRuby is used:
[`examples/repl`](examples/repl/README.md) and
[`examples/virtual-peripheral`](examples/virtual-peripheral/README.md).

### `repl` — evaluate Ruby on the device

A SwiftUI app with a text field, a Run button, and an output view wired to the
bridge. It compiles and runs whatever you type and shows the captured output;
`puts "hello #{1 + 2}"` prints `hello 3`, `raise "boom"` surfaces the exception
without crashing the app.

```
rake ios                      # Simulator: lib -> gen -> build -> run (headless)
rake ios:device:all           # connected device: build, sign, install, launch
```

### `virtual-peripheral` — a BLE peripheral written in Ruby

A PicoRuby-first virtual BLE peripheral, useful as a test stub for debugging a
BLE *central*. `app.rb` is a `BLE` subclass (`role :peripheral`); the **GATT
profile and every per-event behavior** (advertise / read / write / subscribe /
notify) live in it, running in a persistent VM. CoreBluetooth is driven through
picoruby-ble's Darwin port — there is no Swift CoreBluetooth code; Swift only
hosts the VM (a tick timer) and a read-only log. It advertises a Heart Rate
profile as `PBLE-TEST` and answers reads, writes, and subscriptions out of
`app.rb`. Needs the picoruby-ble Darwin port from the `bash0C7/picoruby` fork —
see the [example README](examples/virtual-peripheral/README.md#dependencies).

```
rake ios:vperiph:all          # Simulator (advertising needs a real radio)
rake ios:vperiph:device:all   # connected device: build, sign, install, launch
rake ios:vperiph:write        # macOS BLE central helper that drives the peripheral
```

`rake ios:vperiph:write` builds and runs `tools/ble_write.swift`, a CoreBluetooth
central that scans for `PBLE-TEST`, connects, reads, subscribes, and writes.
`WRITE_HEX`, `TARGET_NAME`, and `APP_SERVICES` pass through the environment
(e.g. `WRITE_HEX=02 rake ios:vperiph:write`).

### On-device builds

Device tasks build for the connected iPhone with automatic signing. Set
`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in the example's `project.yml` to your own team (a free Apple
ID works); the first launch of each bundle id needs a one-time on-device trust
(Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → your Apple ID → Trust).

## How it fits together

```
examples/<name>/Sources (SwiftUI)
        │  Swift ⇄ C bridging header
        ▼
bridge/picoruby_bridge.c   ──▶  libmruby.a (iOS arm64)
  repl_eval(src)                  prism compiler + mruby VM
  vm_open / vm_call / vm_close    cross-built from vendor/picoruby by
                                  build_config/r2p2-picoruby-ios-{sim,device}.rb
```

- `bridge/picoruby_bridge.c` — `repl_eval(src)` evaluates Ruby in a fresh VM and
  captures stdout/stderr; `vm_open`/`vm_call`/`vm_close` own a persistent VM and
  invoke a method on the Ruby global `$app` (used by `virtual-peripheral`). One
  owner thread touches the VM.
- `bridge/task_hal_ios.c` — a polling task-scheduler HAL for iOS (no SIGALRM).
- `build_config/r2p2-picoruby-ios-{sim,device}.rb` — `MRuby::CrossBuild` for the
  `iphonesimulator` / `iphoneos` SDKs via `xcrun`; the base reduced VM.
- `build_config/r2p2-picoruby-host.rb` — the same gem set built for the host, so
  `rake smoke` can exercise the bridge quickly.
- An example that needs extra gems (e.g. BLE) carries its own example-specific
  build config, so it never drags dependencies into the other examples' link.

## Constraints worth knowing

To link cleanly on iOS, the VM uses a **reduced gem set** — no `core`/`stdlib`
gemboxes and no POSIX, so the iOS-incompatible IO / VFS / machine-posix gems are
absent. The Ruby surface is therefore smaller than full mruby/CRuby:

- integer/float math, `String`, string interpolation, `print` / `p`, `raise`,
  `Hash`/`Array` literals + `each`, `while`, ternary, default args, and
  `begin`/`rescue` are available.
- `puts` is not in the reduced VM (it comes from an IO gem); the bridge installs
  a small `puts` shim defined in terms of core `print`.
- `defined?`, `Array#pack`, `String#ord`, `Integer#chr`, `String#<<`, `sprintf`,
  and `String#%` are absent. Probe new bundled Ruby against the host build
  (`rake smoke`'s `libmruby.a`) before relying on it on-device.
