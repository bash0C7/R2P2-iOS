# Networking — the whole HTTP/TLS round-trip is Ruby. `Net::HTTPSClient` comes from
# the linked picoruby-net gem; on iOS it dials a raw BSD socket and runs the TLS
# handshake through mbedTLS (picoruby-net's ports/posix/tls_client.c), seeded by the
# picoruby-mbedtls/rng DARWIN entropy ports (SecRandomCopyBytes via -framework
# Security). No OpenSSL and no Apple URL-loading API, so App Transport Security
# (which only governs NSURLSession/CFNetwork) does not apply.
#
# vm_call(vm, "fetch", "") invokes $app.fetch and returns whatever this prints
# (captured stdout), which the UI appends to its log.
#
# app.rb is compiled at runtime, in-app, by PicoRuby's prism compiler: change the
# host/path below, reinstall, and the request changes with no rebuild of
# libmruby.a or the Swift layer. A successful response means the mbedTLS
# handshake completed on iOS using the Darwin entropy port.
#
# picoruby-net's posix TLS port sets MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_NONE — it completes the
# handshake but does not validate the server certificate. This example demonstrates
# connectivity + handshake, not a trust decision.
